## About this course
This course was designed to provide the building blocks for Python programming and data collection for those choosing a career in Data Science, Data Engineering, AI or Application Development. 

Initially conceived as a foundation course for Data Science and AI it has been refreshed several times to keep pace with emerging career options. Additional content has been added which is applicable to Data Science, Data Engineering, AI or Application Development. 

After completing this course you will have learned foundational skills in Python programming which you can then go on to apply in the Python Project course for your chosen career.  The Python Project courses involve real world scenarios where you are in charge of a final project as a Data Scientist, a Data Engineer, or in AI and Application Development. By finishing this course and your follow-on Python Project, you will gain the basic skills to continue the steps on your chosen career path.  

**Note**: This course is a pre-requisite for the Python Project courses and should be completed in full before attempting the appropriate Python Project course. 


_This course was easy to learn for me because I was already familiar with the topics taught in it. I have also learnt many new things from this course. I am grateful to the instructor._
